# [Austin Node.js User Group](http://www.meetup.com/noders/) Talk Submissions

Interested in speaking at a future meetup? Just [create an issue](https://github.com/nodejsaustin/speaker-submissions/issues/new) in this repo with the following information:

+ Name
+ A good way to contact you (If this is your twitter handle, make sure to follow [@irlnathan](https://twitter.com/irlnathan)so he can DM you to work out the details.)
+ A description of the talk you want to present. You can be as brief or as in-depth as you want -- if we need more information, we'll ask you to clarify in the comments.

That's it! Feel free to go back and edit the issue as much as you need to. Once we've scheduled you to present, we'll close it.
