# [Node.js User Group](http://www.meetup.com/noders/) Talk Submissions

Interested in presenting at a future meetup? Just [create an issue](https://github.com/nodejsaustin/speaker-submissions/issues/new) in this repo with the following information:

+ Name
+ A good way to contact you (If this is your twitter handle, make sure to follow [@irlnathan](https://twitter.com/irlnathan) so he can DM you to work out the details.)
+ A description of the talk you want to present. You can be as brief or as in-depth as you want -- if we need more information, we'll ask you to clarify in the comments.

That's it! Feel free to go back and edit the issue as much as you need to. Once we've scheduled you to present, we'll close it.

> ##### Have an idea, but don't want to talk?
> If you have an idea for a future Meetup topic but don't feel comfortable presenting it yourself, we still want to hear from you! Just submit an issue with the talk description, and include **[NEEDS SPEAKER]** in the title. (Although we really encourage you to give presenting a try, even if haven't spoken at meetups before.)

> On the flip side of this, if you see an issue that needs a speaker and feel you'd be a good fit to present on that topic, please say so in the comments, and include a way to contact you.
